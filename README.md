# Agentic AI LangGraph Learning Journey

Welcome to **Agentic_AI_LangGraph_Learning_Journey** ðŸš€  

This repository is dedicated to my **in-depth study and practice** of **Agentic AI** concepts and **LangGraph** framework. It documents everything I learn â€” from the fundamentals to advanced agent workflows â€” and serves as both a **knowledge base** and a **portfolio** of hands-on projects.

##  Overview  

The goal of this repository is to:
- Learn and master **Agentic AI principles**  
- Explore **LangGraph** and its ecosystem  
- Practice every concept with **Colab notebooks and code examples**  
- Document **notes, explanations, and reviews** for revision  
- Build **mini-projects and experiments** to solidify learning
